## 2026-02-15 QA pass
| Section | File | Result | Status after QA | Key open items |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Front matter | `docs/conversion/sections/00-front-matter.md` | pass | reviewed | None blocking milestone-1 readability goals. |
| Introduction | `docs/conversion/sections/01-introduction.md` | pass | reviewed | Bibliographic details still placeholders. |
| Description of Analyses | `docs/conversion/sections/02-description-of-analyses.md` | pass | reviewed | Minor formatting cleanup can continue opportunistically. |
| Discussion of Programs | `docs/conversion/sections/03-discussion-of-programs.md` | pass | reviewed | Full omitted table/listing content preserved in Fidelity Annex. |
| Description of Subroutines | `docs/conversion/sections/04-description-of-subroutines.md` | pass | reviewed | Full omitted figure/flowchart/listing content preserved in Fidelity Annex. |

## Checklist interpretation notes
- `partial` means content integrity is mostly preserved, but one or more checklist categories fail due intentionally omitted high-volume blocks.
- `reviewed` is assigned only when all checklist gates pass for the target milestone.
