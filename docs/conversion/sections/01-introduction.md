# 1. Introduction

Under Contract NAS 7-458, the Research Laboratories of United Aircraft Corporation are performing analytical studies of the behavior of distributed-feed catalytic reactors for hydrazine decomposition.

The specific objectives of this program are:

1. To develop computer programs for predicting temperature and concentration distributions in monopropellant hydrazine catalytic reactors where hydrazine can be injected at arbitrary locations in the reaction chamber.
2. To perform calculations using these computer programs to demonstrate the effects of various system parameters on reactor performance.

Progress previously reported in the first annual report (Ref. [1]) included development of a computer program describing steady-state behavior of a continuous-flow reactor system assuming complete radial mixing in the free-gas (or liquid) phase.

Progress previously reported in the second annual report (Ref. [2]) included extending the steady-state program to include radial as well as axial variations in temperature and concentrations, enabling analysis of injection schemes and catalyst bed configurations exhibiting radial nonuniformities.

These programs were used to calculate temperature and reactant concentration distributions as functions of feed temperature, chamber pressure, mass-flow-rate distribution, catalyst-size distribution, and embedded injector locations.

As part of the third year of contract effort, attention has been directed toward preparing a manual describing operation of these computer programs for potential users. The manual includes a general description of the one- and two-dimensional models and a detailed discussion of the machine programs representing these models.
